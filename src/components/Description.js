                        I’m a Software Developer currently seeking work in the Greater Milwaukee area. I specifically enjoy working on back-end database and API technologies, but most of all I love to learn new things. Through my years in the grocery vendor sales market I learned many lessons that helped me climb the ranks to become the youngest salesman employed by Nestle, while simultaneously overseeing the largest route in the state of Wisconsin. This was all due to my determination and willingness to learn new things and advance myself. I intend to bring a similar determination to the Software Development field, learning as much as I can from veterans in the business. One day I hope to work on the AI and Machine Learning technologies that continue to revolutionize today’s world.
